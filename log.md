# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: August 2, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Started a weather app. Setup development environment and connected express server to Open Weather API

**Thoughts:** Excited to get this started. I've had a mental block when it comes to coding. This should be a good accelerator.
