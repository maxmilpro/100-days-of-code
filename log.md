# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: August 2, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Started a weather app. Setup development environment and connected express server to Open Weather API

**Thoughts:** Excited to get this started. I've had a mental block when it comes to coding. This should be a good accelerator.

### Day 1: August 3, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Continued to work on retrieving data from Open Weather API. Successfully retrieved seven-day forecast based on location.

**Thoughts:** Still confused about mocking and stubbing. I would like to understand how to write unit tests for api's.

### Day 2: August 4, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Refactored controller to correctly parse and format forecast on the server before sending to client. Completed basic retrieval and rendering data on the client.

**Thoughts:** I was originally unsure if I should format all of the data before sending it to the client or send the raw data and let the client handle. Feels more intuitive to format data on server before sending to client. Good practice for API development.

### Day 3: August 5, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Tackled an algo/data structure problem on LeetCode

**Thoughts:** I need to do more practice problems. There are clearly repeatable/reusable strategies that I need to get more familiar with.

### Day 4: August 6, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Started to add style to my weather app

**Thoughts:** My understanding of front end styling is very limited. I'm pretty behind in this area. Probably an area worth spending more time.

### Day 5: August 7, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Tackled an algo/data structure problem on LeetCode. combinationSum and backtracking

**Thoughts:** Backtacking makes a lot of sense conceptually. I think I can explain how it works to someone else. Implementing is tricky. Combination sum added an interesting wrinkle by allowing duplicate values.

### Day 6: August 8, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Tackled an algo/data structure problem on LeetCode. Had to find subsets from an array of numbers

**Thoughts:** Need to practice for data srructure algorithms
